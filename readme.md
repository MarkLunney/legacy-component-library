## About

This is an example of a legacy (pure) JavaScript project loading a React component and rendering it to the page.

## Quick Start

`npm install`

A module bundler is required to require the 3rd party scripts. Browserify is used here as an example, any other module bundler should work.

`npm install browserify -g`

`browserify main.js -o bundle.js`
